## What is the probability of a random integer being divisible by 5?
the possability of a radnom integer being divisable by 5 is highly likey or in a more spesificsense it would be and 1/5 chance. This is becuase every number that ends with a 5 or a 0 such as 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 etc. are multibles of 5 adn this would allow them to be devided by 5. This means that every number that ends with a 5 or a 0 is divisable by 5 and becuase there is a gap of 5 numbers before each multible of 5 such as 1, 2, 3, 4, (5), 6 ,7 ,8 ,9 (10) etc, it would be a 1/5 chance that a random integer would be divisible by 5.
