## What is the probability of a random integer being divisible by 5?
the possability of a radnom integer being divisable by 5 is highly likey or in a more spesificsense it would be and 1/5 chance. This is becuase every number that ends with a 5 or a 0 such as 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 etc. are multibles of 5 adn this would allow them to be devided by 5. This means that every number that ends with a 5 or a 0 is divisable by 5 and becuase there is a gap of 5 numbers before each multible of 5 such as 1, 2, 3, 4, (5), 6 ,7 ,8 ,9 (10) etc, it would be a 1/5 chance that a random integer would be divisible by 5.

## How to calculate the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of a given pair of numbers?
### LCM
The least common multiple, or LCM, is another number that's useful in solving many math problems. Let's find the LCM of 30 and 45. One way to find the least common multiple of two numbers is to first list the prime factors of each number.

30 = 2 × 3 × 5
45 = 3 × 3 × 5

Then multiply each factor the greatest number of times it occurs in either number. If the same factor occurs more than once in both numbers, you multiply the factor the greatest number of times it occurs.

2: one occurrence 
3: two occurrences 
5: one occurrence 
2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 90 <— LCM

After you've calculated a least common multiple, always check to be sure your answer can be divided evenly by both numbers.

### GCD

GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor. GCD is largest number that divides the given numbers.

GCD Example
Find the GCD of 45 and 54.

Step 1: Find the divisiors of given numbers:

The divisiors of 45 are : 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45

The divisiors of 54 are : 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54

Step 2: Find the greatest number that these two lists share in common. In this example the GCD is 9.
